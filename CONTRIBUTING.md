```python  
DATABASES = {  
    'default': {  
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',  
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',  
        'USER': 'your_username',  
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',  
        'HOST': 'localhost',  
        'PORT': '5432',  
    }  
}  
```  

Run migrations to apply database schema:  

```bash  
python manage.py migrate  
```  

#### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash  
npm install  
```  

#### 5. Start the Development Servers  

- Start the Django server:  

```bash  
python manage.py runserver  
```  

- Start the React development server:  

```bash  
npm start  
```  

Your application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Coding Standards  

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript  

1. **HTML**:  
   - Use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).  
   - Follow accessibility guidelines (e.g., ARIA attributes).  

2. **CSS**:  
   - Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming conventions.  
   - Avoid inline styles; prefer external stylesheets.  

3. **JavaScript**:  
   - Use ES6+ syntax (e.g., `const`, `let`, arrow functions).  
   - Modularize code into reusable components.  

---

### Python/Django  

1. **PEP 8 Compliance**:  
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.  
   - Use tools like `flake8` or `black` for linting.  

2. **Django Best Practices**:  
   - Keep views, models, and serializers modular.  
   - Use Django REST Framework for API endpoints.  

---

### React (Frontend)  

1. **Component Structure**:  
   - Use functional components with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).  
   - Organize components into folders (e.g., `components/`, `containers/`).  

2. **State Management**:  
   - Use Redux or Context API for global state management.  

---

## Testing Procedures  

### Unit Testing  

Write unit tests for individual functions, components, or modules. Use frameworks like:  
- **Python**: `pytest` or `unittest`.  
- **JavaScript**: `Jest`.  

---

### Integration Testing  

Test interactions between components or services. Ensure APIs, databases, and frontend/backend integrations work seamlessly.

fix: Resolve issue with login authentication  
docs: Update README with contribution guidelines  
```  

---

### Updating Documentation  

Ensure all changes are reflected in relevant documentation files (e.g., `README.md`, `API.md`).  

---

## Code Review Process  

All PRs undergo a rigorous review process:  
1. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipelines run tests and linting.  
2. **Manual Review**: Maintainers evaluate code quality, functionality, and adherence to standards.  

---
